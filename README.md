## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- JavaScript
- React
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### SASS

This project is a good oppotunity for me to practice SASS in the real project, and I must say that I love the way SASS work. I learn a lot including how to structure all selector using SASS and keep it in a more modularity, how to nest a selector to avoid too much complicate naming and clashed of tag used, also how to create a theme. This make me want to use SASS much more in my future project to come.

#### CSS

With pure CSS, I have learn to use selector to manipulate the class name and change the way the styling work with some behavior. This give me a new idea for me and I will be using this knowledge for other project as well.

#### JavaScript

I have use a lot of JavaScript in this project since it is React-base. This give me the chances
to use many array method including map, some, filter, foreach, spread and much more. I think my knowledge is significantly improve in this project!

#### React

Last but not least, React. This library sure give me a lot of headache, and the same time a lot of discovering. I manage to use many state and fine-tune my app until I reach the point that I am satisfying with the outcome. I can proudly say that this app boost my knowledge about React and make me thirst to learn and explore about it more in the future!

### Continued development

This app make me proud. I've never thought that I can build this kind of app in the past, let alone make it so good like this before. But as I develop and finished this app I've soon realize that I have to learn more. The area that I want to learn more after this is...

- React state
- CSS grid
- JavaScript object
- React lifecycle

### Useful resources

- [Traversy Media youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) - This guy have always been my go to channel for every topic that I want to learn. His clear explaination and project-base video is always help me understand complex topic every time. Many respect to him.

- [The Net Ninja youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) - This is also valuable youtube channel that I visit to learn every topic. I heavily use this site while building this project to learn about React and try to understand and implement my own logic using the knowledge from this site. Many thanks to him as well.

- [Web Dev Simplify youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) This site give me a high level understanding of the topic. I didn't go to this site much but I can say after building this app that this site is pack with many valuable content. I plan to use this site more in the future.

- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This is helping me to find solution for many of my problems. Really a lifesaver site.
